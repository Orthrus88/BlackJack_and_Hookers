# BlackJack_and_Hookers
## Simple Blackjack Game in Python

This is a simple text-based implementation of the Blackjack card game using Python. It allows a single player to play against the computer dealer.

## How to Play

1. Run the `blackjack.py` script in your Python environment.
2. The game will start, and you will receive two cards as the player, and the dealer will also receive two cards, with one face-up and one face-down.
3. Your goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.
4. You can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stand" to keep your current hand.
5. If the value of your hand exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the game.
6. If you reach exactly 21 with your initial two cards, you achieve a "Blackjack" and win the game.
7. Once you stand, the dealer will then reveal their face-down card and draw more cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.
8. If the dealer busts, you win. Otherwise, the player and dealer hands are compared, and the one closest to 21 without going over wins.

## Rules

- Number cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value gives the best hand without exceeding 21.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the game with the following command:
    >python blackjack.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Possible Improvements

This implementation is basic and text-based, but you can expand and enhance the game in various ways:

- Add support for multiple players.
- Create a graphical user interface using a Python GUI library like Tkinter or Pygame.
- Implement a betting system where players can place bets on their hands.
- Include additional features like split, double down, and insurance.
- Improve the AI for the computer dealer.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own blackjack game or as a learning exercise to enhance your Python programming skills.
